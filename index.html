        Hi, I am <a href="mailto:arold.adam@gmail.com">Adam</a>.
        I consider myself a pragmatic software engineer and I also like to share my thoughts on programming,
        thus the name of this site:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <strong>Cogitate</strong><br/>
        <em>verb</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;think deeply about something; meditate or reflect.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I have been programming since the age of 17 and I have been working on things like
        BigData pipelines, embedded systems, websites under high load, game development and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also work on multiplatform <a href="https://github.com/Hexworks/cobalt">tools</a>
        which might be useful for you in your everyday job.
    </p>
    <p>I'm using <strong>Kotlin</strong>, so if you need help or consulting for your Kotlin project feel free to</p>

    <h3>Things I'm working on</h3>
    <p>On this site I write <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/posts.html">articles about programming</a> in general and I
        also
        specialize in <strong>Kotlin</strong>. If you are a <em>Java</em> developer who wants to get started with the language you are in the
    right place.</p>
    <p>I also work on the <a href="https://github.com/Hexworks/cobalt">Cobalt multiplatform utilities library</a>.
