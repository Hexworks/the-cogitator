    <p>
        Hi, I am <a href="mailto:arold.adam@gmail.com">Adam</a>.
        I'm a pragmatic software engineer and I like to shave with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's Razor</a>
        and find solutions which are robust and simple.
        Although I like tinkering with stuff and I embrace the
        <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">Hacker mindset</a>
        I also think that as an engineer my job is to focus on solving real problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        I firmly believe that to do so we need to gather data, analyze and synthesize it
        and base decisions on what we know, thus the name of this site:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <strong>Cogitate</strong><br/>
        <em>verb</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;think deeply about something; meditate or reflect.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The aim of this site is to share insight about technologies I touch during my work.
