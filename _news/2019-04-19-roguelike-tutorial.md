> As you may have seen by blog did not get updates for a while now. The reason for this is that
I was working on a [Tutorial Project](https://hexworks.org/posts/tutorials/2018/12/04/how-to-make-a-roguelike.html)
lately which *I'm publishing here now*!

## Summary

I've decided to add the articles in the tutorial series to this site as well, so both the readers
of *my blog* and the [Hexworks Site](https://hexworks.org/) get access to this tutorial!

These posts are about writing a [Roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game in
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). It starts with very simple *Kotlin* concepts so it can also
be used to learn the language as well, not just roguelike development. You can check out
the first one [here](/posts/blog/2018/12/04/how-to-make-a-roguelike.html)!

Since there are already some article series on this site I'll soon add a proper *series navigation*
page for them. I've seen a lot of blogs with series like these and navigating them is
usually very clunky. I'm not going to make this mistake here, so stay tuned!
